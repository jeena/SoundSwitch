soundswitch.py
================

This script listens to two audio input devices and determins which one is louder
at a given moment and presses programatically one of two defined keys. If for
some time nobody is speaking or everyone at roughly the lame volume then it
presses a third defined key.

With help of this you can for example switch between scenes in
[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to show the person who is currently speaking.
